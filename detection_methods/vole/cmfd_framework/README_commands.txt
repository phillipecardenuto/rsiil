If you successfully compiled the code (described in README_build.txt), you should have a binary
cmfd_framework/build/bin/vole

Invoking it with the 'help' parameter, i.e.
  cmfd_framework/build/bin/vole --help
prints

-----------------------------snip---------------------------------
          =x= vole image forensics toolkit =x=

Usage: ./bin/vole [--help] command [configfile] [options ...]

All options can also be given in the specified config file.
Options given in the command line will overwrite options from the file.

Available commands:
  cmfd: Copy-Move Forgery Detection Framework
  gt:   Find the source and insertion coordinates of a snippet
  gt_get_snippet:       computes the changed regions between original and tampered image
  gt_postproc:  post-processing for the ground truth data
  pp:   post processing of detection maps generated by forgery detection methods, e.g. cmfd
  splice:       splices images, creates ground truth automatically
  splice_rb:    splices images with random blocks, creates ground truth automatically
-----------------------------snap---------------------------------

The commands 'cmfd' and 'pp' can be used for the detection of Copy-Move forgeries
and the post-processing of the output (map of duplicated regions)

The commands 'gt', 'gt_get_snippet', 'gt_postproc', 'splice' and 'splice_rb'
can be used for the ground truth creation.

To invoke a command, pass it as the first parameter to vole. Every command
supports its own 'help' parameter.

---------------------------- cmfd ------------------------------------------------
cmfd is the copy-move forgery detector.

  cmfd_framework/build/bin/vole cmfd --help
floods the screen with parameters to the copy-move forgery detector. This is by
far the most complex command in this package. A description of the parameters
can be found in README_cmfd_options.txt
Example calls can be found in README_examples.txt
---------------------------- cmfd ------------------------------------------------

---------------------------- pp ------------------------------------------------
Allows separate postprocessing of matched copy-move features. It can be used to
close holes in a detected area. Typically, this command should not be required,
as all functionality of 'pp' is also contained in the command 'cmfd'. A comment
for using the command stand-alone is contained in the last part of
README_cmfd_options.txt
---------------------------- pp ------------------------------------------------

---------------------------- remaining commands --------------------------------
'gt_get_snippet', 'gt_postproc', 'splice' and 'splice_rb' are typically called
from the perl scripts (see README_ground_truth_examples.txt for details on the
scripts). However, it is also possible to invoke these commands directly.
Either use the --help parameter, or have a look at the perl scripts to see the
calling conventions. If everything fails, feel free to contact
christian.riess@informatik.uni-erlangen.de.
