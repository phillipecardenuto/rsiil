# Recod.ai Scientific Image Integrity Library

A collection of algorithms to synthetically create scientific images for forensics and integrity analysis.

An in-depth explanation of each algorithm and dataset is described in our research work:
[Benchmarking Scientific Image Forgery Detectors](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-022-00391-4)



## Library

The library implements the most type of image tampering functions.

1. Image Duplication
2. Retouching 
3. Cleaning

This [notebook](https://github.com/phillipecardenuto/rsiil/blob/main/notebooks/Tampering-Simple-Scientific-Figures.ipynb) explains how to apply each type of forgery in a scientific image.


The library also mimics the behavior of images placed in scientific documents, such as compound figures -- with indicative letters and graphs.

There are two possible types of forgeries for compound figures:

1. Intra-panel (forgeries that are isolated within a single panel from the compound figure)

   [Notebook](https://github.com/phillipecardenuto/rsiil/blob/main/notebooks/Tampering-Compound-Intra-Panel-Scientific-Figures.ipynb) explaining each type of implemented forgery

2. Inter-panel (forgeries that involve more than one figure panel):

**Requirements:**

To run the notebooks, make sure to install python3.8 and the modules included in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/phillipecardenuto/rsiil/blob/main/requirements.txt).



# Recod.ai Scientific Image Integrity Dataset

Using the implemented library, we created a synthetic dataset dedicated to forensics purposes and scientific integrity.

[Templates](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11DXW_yFEZsje0aJyZDGaT4cJwwz2Dmzt/view?usp=sharinG)



## Dataset Organization

Both train and test sets have simple and compound figures, organized with the following schematic:
