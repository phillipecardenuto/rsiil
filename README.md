# Recod.ai Scientific Image Integrity Library

A collection of algorithms to synthetically create scientific image for forensics and integrity analysis.



## Library

The library  implements the most type image tampering functions.

1. Image Duplication
2. Retouching 
3. Cleaning

This [notebook](https://github.com/phillipecardenuto/rsiil/blob/repo-org/notebooks/Tampering-Simple-Scientific-Figures.ipynb) explains how to apply each type of forgery in a scientific image



The library also mimics the behavior of images placed in scientific documents, such as compound figures -- with indicative letters and graphs.

There is two possible types of forgeries for compound figures:

1. Intra-panel (forgeries that are isolated within a single panel from the compound figure)

   [Notebook](https://github.com/phillipecardenuto/rsiil/blob/repo-org/notebooks/Tampering-Compound-Intra-Panel-Scientific-Figures.ipynb) explaining each type of implemented forgery

2. Inter-panel (forgeries that involve more than one panel of the figure):

**Requirements:**

To run the notebooks, make sure to install python3.8 and the modules from included in the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/phillipecardenuto/rsiil/blob/repo-org/requirements.txt) .



# Recod.ai Scientific Image Integrity Dataset

Using the implemented library, we created a synthetic dataset dedicated for forensic purpose of scientific images.

## Dataset Organization

Both train and test set have simple and compound figures, organized with the following schematic:
